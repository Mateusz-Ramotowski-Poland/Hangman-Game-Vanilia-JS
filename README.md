## General Information
This project is a web browser game. I made it for practising my programming skills. In this project I focused on learning JS. It works on all resolutions. I must change JavaScript code - now it doesn't work on Firefox.

## Technologies Used
Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JS
* Canvas API

## Features
- The application shows messages for the player.
- When a player loses a life, part of the gallows or part of the hangman is drawn inside the canvas tag.
- When you click a button with a letter/space, this button becomes inactive.
- The application randomizes the word for the player to guess. There are 4 word categories in the game, each category has 5 words.
- The application saves the top 3 high scores. Score = number of lives. 
- The player can play again if the 'play again' button is pressed.

Project is in progress.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by https://megoh.github.io/projects/hangman/index.html. Thank you for the idea for the app. I also used the hangman drawing part of the code of this project - I reworked it in my project to draw a similar drawing.
